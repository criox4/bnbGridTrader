#!/bin/sh
# Create the data subdirectories at START, not at build.
#
# /data is a named volume. Docker seeds a volume from the image ONLY when the
# volume is empty at first creation — so a `mkdir` in the Dockerfile is invisible
# to any deployment whose volume already exists. Adding a new *_PATH after the
# first `compose up` is exactly that case: the directory is in the image and
# still absent in the container, and the writer fails silently.
#
# Idempotent, cheap, correct for both fresh and upgraded volumes.
